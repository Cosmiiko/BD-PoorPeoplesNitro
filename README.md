# Poor People's Nitro
 A BetterDiscord plugin that sends emotes' links when you click on them.  
 Useful if you don't have nitro but still want to use custom emotes.

Caveats:  
- Can't use the emotes in the middle of messages, only as stickers (separate messages).
- Not the same size as Discord emotes. Discord emotes are 48x48 but they are only saved on their servers at standard resolutions (16x16, 32x32, 64x64, and so on). Closest you'll get is 32x & 64x.
